<strong>ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT</strong>
Our Bovine Rendering Plant and Biodiesel Plant highly achieves the required standards.
 All the remaining material from our slaughtering plant, such as bone and fat are supplies of our Bovine Rendering Plant, where are produced the following products:</br></br>
 
•	Meat and Bone Meal</br>
•	Melted tallow or Industrial tallow</br></br>
 
The melted tallow is the main supply for our Biodiesel plant, which also process vegetal oil. 
This way, Frigorífico Guarani strengthens its commitment to the environment.
